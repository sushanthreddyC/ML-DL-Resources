Interview Questions
1)How would you approach cleaning and preprocessing a dataset with missing values and outliers? Could you provide an example of a technique you've used for this purpose?

2)When dealing with a large and complex dataset, what are some strategies you would employ to efficiently explore its structure and identify relevant patterns?

3) Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Provide an example of a problem that would require each of these approaches.

4)In the context of machine learning, what is overfitting? How can you prevent or mitigate overfitting when training a model?

5) What are the key steps involved in a typical natural language processing (NLP) pipeline? Can you walk me through these steps using a specific NLP task as an example?

6)When working with text data, how would you convert words into numerical representations that can be used as input for machine-learning algorithms?

7. When creating a data visualization to compare the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories, which type of plot (e.g., histogram, box plot, violin plot) would you choose and why?

8) How can you effectively use color and design principles to enhance the clarity and impact of your data visualizations?
